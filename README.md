I love to play in capture the flag competitions to learn more about cybersecurity and all that it entails. I try to create writeups that are beginner-friendly and I try my best to explain my thought process so other beginners can learn from my mistakes. 

BCACTF was my first time posting my writeups but I lost all my past writeups as I forgot to make a backup.  :( 
Enjoy and have fun!
